## Plowshare legacy modules matrix

Here is current hosters support list:
<!-- === BEGIN MATRIX === -->
<!-- === END MATRIX === -->
Few notes:
* "account" means that both "free" and "premium" accounts are supported.
* Emoticons meaning:
  - :cookie: (**plowdown**) final url download requires cookies. Mostly valid for anonymous downloads.
  - :lock: mandatory login (it's common to have anonymous upload disabled by hosters).
 -  :recycle: session management is handled by module (avoids multiple logins).
  - :rocket: (**plowup**) supports remote upload (usually requires premium account).
* Square brackets display dedicated command line options for a module and a function (download, upload, etc.).
* Characters in **plowprobe** column refer to the sequences interpreted by plowprobe's `--printf` command line option.
For example, "c" means the module can report a file's health (dead link or not).
Please see `man plowprobe` for more information.
